      Cosmetic dentistry focuses on improving the appearance of the teeth, gums and overall
       smile. While general dentistry is concerned with the health and function of the teeth,
        cosmetic dental treatment is designed to enhance aesthetics. Whether itâ€™s through
         whitening, reshaping or replacing teeth, cosmetic dentistry aims to create a more 
         attractive smile. Unlike general dentistry, which is necessary for maintaining oral 
         health, cosmetic dentistry is typically elective, helping to address concerns about 
         the look of your teeth rather than their health
